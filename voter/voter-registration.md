   * **IOS users**: [Download “Catalyst Voting” from the IOS store](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/catalyst-voting/id1517473397?l=en)
4. Registration _must be completed_ before snapshot date
5. Note: there is a registration fee of 0.17 -0.18 ADA



## Registration

* IMPORTANT: If you registered in Fund 4 and/or Fund 5 and were able to cast votes - your registration will be automatically valid for Fund 6 voting round! Provided you still have your QR and PIN code. Don't need to re-register. This does not apply to Fund 2 or Fund 3 registrations. Your voting power, however, will be updated during the new snapshot relevant for Fund 6.
* For Fund6, only voter registration is open at the moment. You will get the QR and PIN code from the wallet you use to register.&#x20;
* Regardless of your wallet, each registration will provide you with a unique QR and PIN code. These must absolutely be saved. _No QR code saved, no vote! No PIN code saved, no vote!_

1\. Install the latest version of the Catalyst Voting application (version 0.1.15) on your mobile device.&#x20;

2\. In the latest version of Daedalus, navigate to the voting registration page from the menu on the left-hand side.

* Confirm that you have installed the Catalyst Voting app.
* Confirm that you hold at least 500 ADA at the time of the snapshot.
* Click on "Register to vote"

3\. Select the wallet you wish to vote with and click "Continue" **(ensure the wallet contains the minimum required amount for voting: 500 ADA \*excluding rewards\*)**\


_Note: This amount must remain in this wallet until the snapshot, which will collect your voting power. Dates and times of the snapshots for each Fund will be announced through our official social and communication channels_

5\. Wait for approximately 5 minutes until the transaction is confirmed by the blockchain and click "Continue". Do not close Daedalus during this time, otherwise your registration will be cancelled and you will need to start over:

6\. Set a 4 digit PIN code of your choice, confirm it and click "Continue".

**Please make sure to remember it or write it down as you will need it for voting later on. Note that if you lose the PIN you will not be able to vote and you will need to repeat the registration process to select a new PIN:**

7\. Daedalus will generate a QR code that you will use on Catalyst App to complete the registration and to cast your votes.

* Click **"Save as PDF"**&#x20;
* Click **"Save"** in the dialog
* Note that if you don't save the QR code you wont be able to complete your registration and vote.&#x20;

This concludes the registration process.



## Voting

13\. Now you need to wait until the voting starts. When the voting starts you will see your voting power, corresponding to the amount of ADA, which you had in your wallet at the time of the snapshot. In our case the voting power will be 984.

14\. Read through the different proposals and place your vote (Yes or No). You can vote for a single proposal, for several proposals or for all proposals - it is up to you. The number of votes will not impact the amount of your reward, same if you do not vote at all.

15\. Select a proposal.
