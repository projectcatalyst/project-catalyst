# Voter Overview

**What is voting in Project Catalyst?**

In each Project Catalyst funding round Ada holders are able to vote for which projects they want to be funded by the community. Collectively the total Ada from voters will decide which proposals will get funded. The proposals that get funded will influence how the Cardano ecosystem will evolve over time.



**Why should I vote?**

As a voter, you can influence the future development in the Cardano ecosystem. You will be part of the largest DAO and decentralized venture capital fund in the world.

**Who should / can vote?**

Every Ada holder that has at least 500 Ada in a wallet can use it to vote. Future funding rounds aim to have the minimum threshold decrease over time.

**How can I vote?**

For voting you can use a number of different wallets such as [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/), [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io) or [Adalite](https://adalite.io) wallets. Within a given wallet you will need to register to vote before voting.
