# Community Advisor Onboarding

### What is a Community Advisor?

This term is often abbreviated to ‘CA’ or ‘CAs’. Their stated principal role is to review proposals after they have been submitted and provide guidance to voters. This is done by assigning a ranking for various factors outlined in the guidelines. There is also an undefined role as community stewards, helping others through the onboarding process and working with the community including proposers and other CAs to look for and help solve gaps in the growing ecosystem that is Project Catalyst.



### Why am I receiving this communiqué?

You are receiving this email because you have logged into Ideascale recently and upon being presented with the popup with the question:

“By choosing "I want to be a CA", you confirm the statement: "I commit to provide fair and thoughtful reviews", is true.”

You have answered:

“I want to be a Community Advisor (CA) - I understand the role” or “I'm a proposer and want to be a Community Advisor (CA) - I understand that I can't propose and CA in the same challenge”



You can edit this if you did so unintentionally by logging into [https://cardano.Ideascale.com](https://cardano.ideascale.com) and clicking on the menu in the top right after -> My community activity -> Edit profile questions -> “Community Advisor registration form!” (change the bottom drop down menu).



### Where can I find the current Community Advisor Guidelines?

The current [assessment guide](assessment-guide/) is maintained on another page. Check back regularly as the guide may be updated before the review process starts.



### What is the process to review proposals?

1. Find a proposal to review.
2. Read the proposal carefully and ensure you understand it.
3. Think about how well the proposal addresses the three criteria being Impact, Feasibility and Auditability
4. Give each category a rating between 1-5 stars and write (where 1 is strongly disagree, 2 is disagree, 3 is neutral, 4 is agree and 5 is strongly agree). In the text box provided ensure that your rationale why you gave this rating, what you think the voter should know and if applicable (low rating) how the proposer could improve the rating in a future fund.&#x20;
5. Check if you followed all steps and if you’re content with the quality of your assessment.
6. Decide if you want to rate another proposal and in this case start at 1. again.

There are far too many proposals for most CAs to attempt to review all of them. Some may also not be of interest or be outside of your technical ability to review. Do not feel like you need to review all of the proposals. Review as many as you feel comfortable and competent to review. The quality of your review can directly impact the quality of votes and therefore the quality of the proposals that are funded.



### Where can I find some review examples?

The [assessment guide](assessment-guide/) has examples of useful and not so useful assessment examples. It can be found here. When reviewing, ask yourself, “is their rationale reasonable and helpful to the voters?”, “Is the review in line with the Community Advisor review guidelines?” and “has the review offered valuable feedback to the proposer about how they could improve their proposal?”



### How can I find which proposal needs reviewing?

There is a tool made by the community that can assist with finding low assessed proposals - https://cardanocataly.st/ca-tool/. Fund 4 is the first time it was introduced. It’s in development and the community encourages feedback to make it better each Fund cycle.



### Are there rewards for being a Community Advisor?

Community advisors are acknowledged for their time and thoughtfulness in reviewing proposals and offering quality reviews. Total reward pot for Fund7 is $1,600,000 in ada from a total fund size of 8,000,000 in ada. Where 4% of the fund ($320,000 in ada) is allocated to CAs and 1% to vCAs ($80,000 in ada). For more details on this new rewarding algo - please reference Catalyst town hall slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xi8COzkjn7vINiWNnSRay0as2nyrHNRLkng\_oh8JYzU/edit) and video explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2373\&v=9LfHn5mZJZk\&feature=youtu.be\&ab\_channel=IOHK).



### Do Catalyst Natives rewards differ from other rewards?

Additionally, there is a special challenge category introducing a Catalyst Native participant - COTI Network. All work carried out with reference to this category will be paid out in their native token - COTI. In order to receive your rewards for the Catalyst Natives COTI Adapay challenge, CAs must provide a valid wallet address that can receive ERC-20 tokens.



COTI will be responsible for providing the rewards and Catalyst will provide COTI with all of the eligible wallets and their respective rewards amounts once Fund7 has concluded. Payment should be anticipated around the same time as Catalyst rewards are paid out in ada, though this is not guaranteed to happen on the same day.



The role of a community advisor can extend beyond the reviews process. If you choose to do so you can engage deeply with the community, the proposers and other community advisors and bring your own level of meaningful participation in working towards the building of project Catalyst. Your level of engagement is up to you and your circumstances.



### What happens if I don’t follow the guidelines when submitting reviews?

Your assessments will not be included and no rewards will be payable. Please, reference the [assessment guide](assessment-guide/) for understanding how to submit quality reviews.



### Where can I go for more information?

A great place to start is the Project Catalyst Community Advisors telegram channel. It’s a very welcoming place. Join and mention that you are new and you’ll find a great group of people ready to help you out, discuss issues and have fun. https://t.me/CatalystCommunityAdvisors



There is a weekly Town Hall meeting for the Project Catalyst community. It’s the best place to keep up with new developments in the project. You can keep track of the upcoming townhalls by signing up [here](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEtduyupzMvHNUczCQwfFJGcXzmw2lDwkIf) or rewatch past town halls [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnPTB0CuBOByRhpTUdALq4J89m\_h7QqLk).



Note: It is part of the guidelines that CAs attend or watch a recording of the Townhall to ensure they know the latest info and can answer questions of the community if they choose to do so.



Further discussion is done in the Project Catalyst discord server: https://discord.gg/2RnUtK8



There is a section for CA. Ask questions in general if you're not sure what you are looking at, where to go or what to do.



A community landing page is under ongoing development. It is a place where many resources can be found. If you want to have a look it can be found here: https://cardanocataly.st
