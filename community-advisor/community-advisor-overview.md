# Community Advisor Overview

**What is a community advisor?**

Community Advisors (CA) review other peoples proposals that are trying to get funding in Project Catalyst. A CA will review a proposal against a set of objectives for the campaign that the proposal is asking for funding from. The CA will provide a numerical score along with an explanation that covers the rationale behind the score given.

CAs help voters have more information on whether proposals are impactful, feasible and auditable so that voters can make more informed decisions on which proposals to vote for.

CAs also help proposers by giving them feedback on how to improve their proposals which helps increase the overall quality of the proposals in each funding round.
