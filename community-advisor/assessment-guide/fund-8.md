# Fund 8

### Strategic goals

Fund8 Challenge Setting has taken input from community and IOG stakeholders as part of a horizon scanning activity to help focus and centre Community Challenge Setting on some core themes and attributes.



Challenges should be aligned with the Fund8 strategic goals:

1. Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.&#x20;
2. Turn Cardano into an open source project.&#x20;
3. Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem.



If Fund8 Challenge Setting proposals do not meet one or more of the above attributes, then assessment prioritisation by CAs and voters should favour proposals which do meet these goals.
