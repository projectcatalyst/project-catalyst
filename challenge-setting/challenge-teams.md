# Challenge Teams

The purpose of this document is to capture changes in the “Challenge setting” challenge and introduce a new community role in Catalyst “Challenge teams” towards a pilot during Fund6.



### Problem statement

With +20 challenges, and “handover” of challenge setting to the community, the Catalyst team cannot keep up with the efforts needed to work with challenges effectively:&#x20;

1. There is no incentive for authors of challenge setting proposals.&#x20;
2. Challenge ROI, needs to be tracked not only by numbers, but also through careful analysis and communicated back to the community.
3. Knowledge and expertise around the problem-space should be maintained. Catalyst needs people to care about these themes.

The intention is for the Challenge Teams pilot to be dynamic and responsive to feedback. Dynamic in that it can be spun up with more people and resources when the needs emerge and responsive so to be led by discussion by and for community participants. If you're a Challenge Team you are the eyes and ears to feedback to the Catalyst Team and community about whether or not the pilot is working.



### **What is the role?**

The role of Challenge Teams is to steward the challenges in Catalyst - to present the challenge, track the progress, and report back to the community their perspective on whether the challenges were addressed. In return, the proposing team has an opportunity to receive a “Challenge team” incentive of $2,500 worth of ada.



### Emancipating the community

The purpose of having the Project Catalyst community submit their own challenges is to emancipate the platform from the Project Catalyst team. Eventually, the Cardano community will control the innovation and collaboration process from inception to delivery. With that in mind, it is crucial that we understand what an impactful challenge looks like.



**Focus on advancement** - The challenge is a question which helps the community focus

**Alignment** - **** This challenge is critical to achieve Cardano's mission.

**Feasibility** - The Catalyst community has the capacity to address the challenge. Bonus if there's an established challenge team.

**Verifiability** - Success criteria and suggested metrics are set correctly to measure progress in addressing the challenge.



### Definition of Challenge Teams and guidelines

Challenge teams are the winning proposers of community-set challenges. These are people whose challenge got approved via a community vote and then they accepted the role.



Think of Challenge Teams as a project liaison role - you are the eyes and ears of the health of each challenge. You care about its outcomes and are willing to get up close to the winning teams in order to understand the nuances of their projects and communicate this back to the Catalyst community.



### **Eligibility**

To be eligible for receiving the Challenge Teams award, there are three main aspects to fulfil:

1. All members of each Challenge Teams must nominate themselves as co-proposers in the Challenge Setting Challenge proposal on Ideascale by the time of final submission.&#x20;
2. The finalised Challenge Setting Challenge proposal must be submitted by the deadlines
3. Once a challenge setting proposal is accepted by the community, the proposing team will receive a “Challenge team” incentive of $2,500 worth of ada, once all of the following conditions are met:&#x20;
   * The challenge team presents the challenge to the community at the start of the following fund.&#x20;
   * The challenge team facilitates a challenge-focused breakout session in one of the after townhalls.&#x20;
   * The challenge team leads a challenge retrospective session during the next fund’s “retrospective week”.
   * The challenge team facilitates a session with the proposing teams that received funding for the challenge. This could be during the Coordinator Onboarding where newly funded projects first meet the Catalyst team.
   * For 3 months, the Challenge Team is responsible for communicating to the community on the progress of funded proposal projects and their key metrics, perhaps as part of the Coordinator meetings. Challenge teams will present their reflection on whether the Challenge is getting addressed and highlights teams that are making significant headway in their approach.



These activities might seem complicated at first glance, however you will receive guidelines, training and support from the Catalyst team and community. All you need is a willingness to represent the challenge in a fair and balanced way and a desire to participate. Once the conditions are met, your team will be eligible to receive the reward.



Once these activities are complete, teams can reach out to the Catalyst team to receive their reward.
